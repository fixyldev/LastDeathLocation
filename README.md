## 🗒️ Description
Last Death Location is a data pack for Minecraft Java Edition that allows players to view recent death locations. These locations can be accessed with the menu. The history can store up to 16 recent deaths. The data pack also offers several options to customize the player's experience. As there is no need for a Recovery Compass to view the last death location, some may consider this data pack as a form of **cheat**.
